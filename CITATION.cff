abstract: BVQA is a python command line tool that lets you ask a series of predefined questions to a vision language model (VLM) about a collection of images. It saves the answers in json files (one file per image).

Main use cases:
1. efficient extraction of semantic features from a large collection of images; 
2. model selection: objectively compare the performance (quality of responses, resource utilisation, speed) of different models on the same questions and images.
